<h2>Welcome to Random Tour 3000</h2>
<p>This app lets you explore Berlin's public transport stations at random. The main areas of the app are explained below.</p>

<h3>Home – Roll a station</h3>
<p>Press the <strong>ROLL</strong> button or shake your phone to draw a random station. A 20 second cooldown avoids accidental double rolls. Disable it under settings if you prefer instant rolls.</p>

<h3>Station view</h3>
<p>After rolling you see details about the station: served lines and your visit history. Mark the station as visited, add notes or attach photos. Visits can be edited or removed later.</p>

<h3>Visited</h3>
<p>The <strong>Visited Stations</strong> tab lists every place you have checked off so far. Sort the list by name or by date to review your progress.</p>

<h3>All stations</h3>
<p>The <strong>All Stations</strong> view shows the complete network. Use the search to find places manually and add visits that were not rolled.</p>

<h3>Backups</h3>
<p>Your data is stored only in the browser. Use <strong>Settings → Backups</strong> to export a JSON file or import a previous backup so nothing gets lost.</p>

<h3>Settings & account</h3>
<p>Change the language, define a home station for travel time calculations, toggle the roll cooldown and manage your account (change password, log out or delete account).</p>

<p>Enjoy your random tour through Berlin!</p>
